# Recaman-4-matlab

This project provides nice illustrations of the Recaman sequence. Some change.

The Recaman-sequence is an intriguing integer-sequence (OEIS sequence:
A005132). The long-term behaviours of this sequence is not known.

This package contains a function for the sequence, an
example-plotting-script and for now an initial start of a test-script.

This update adds a nice figure, and the script to generate it, as well
as a first test (to be later evolved into an integrated unit-test)
